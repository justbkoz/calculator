# calculator
simple calculator (started Apr 2021)

This is the last project in The Odin Project's foundations course.

The goal is to make a functioning calculator using basic javascript, html, and css.



Learning Outcome: (as of mid-Apr 2021)
    Calculator is functioning! however I'm looking forward to learning how to write modular code.  Feels like I did way too much copy pasting, and that I could have done the work with way less effort.

    I learned about javascript's limitations when dealing with math and remainders.  Although I do not believe I found a best practice on how to deal with those limitations. 

    Much of the CSS is copy/pasted.  I understand basics, but doubt I could come up with most of it without google.

If I spend more time with this project:
    Need to test my keyboard support with a full keyboard

    The display doesnt look correct with too many characters in it.

    I'd like to get the CSS looking better

    Add the ability to resize the whole calculator, and work on different size displays

    Add the ability to have it in a pop-up custom size window
